# What problems does it solve?

- I need to know what will happen before I run something
  - `terraform plan`

- I need to have a way to reproduce my infrastructure
  - Declare resources in a terraform file
  - Version it with git

---

# How does it works?

1. You declare your infrastructure as a set of resources. (Desired state)
1. You run `terraform plan` to see what terraform will do without actually doing it
1. You run `terraform apply` to make it happen

???


---

# Resources

- Resources are components of your infrastructure
- Can be low or high level
- They take a set of arguments (required or optional)
- Exported attributes (like returned values)

---

# Interpolation syntax

- Way of evaluating an expression when terraform will run
- Helps Terraform to work out the dependency order of creation
- Makes refactoring easier

`"${<resource_type>.<resource_name>.<exported_attribute>}"`

---

```
resource "scaleway_server" "test" {
  name  = "test"
  image = "aecaed73-51a5-4439-a127-6d8229847145"
  type  = "C2S"
}
```


```
"${scaleway_server.test.image}"
```

???

You can have data source that allows you to check if you have correctly defined
a resource

---

Locals

`"${<local>.<variable_name>}"`

---

output

Useful to return useful information

---

# Data Types

- Int
- String
- List
- Boolean

---

# Provider

```
A provider in Terraform is responsible for the lifecycle of a resource:
  - create
  - read
  - update
  - delete
```

Each vendor is going to support its own provider.
You can have mutiple cloud in a single project.
You can have multiple regions by using different provider

???

You can define aliases on the provider.
This allows you to duplicate infrastructure easily by using the aliases

---

Project layout

Terraform only looks in your current directory.
Not below nor above.

It combines all files that end in `.tf` into one.

---

# Provisionner

Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction.

- [chef](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/chef.html)
- [salt](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/salt-masterless.html)
- [local-exec](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html)
- [remote-exec](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/remote-exec.html)

---

# Terraform state

- Where terraform store all the known state of your infrastructure.
- Used to gather what exists to compute the diff of what needs to happen to reach the desired state

Beware: Multiple users modifying it in the same time.

Beware: If you delete it, terraform will recreate all your resources.

???

By default stored locally
Can be stored remotly

You can use terraform state rm <resource_command>

---

terraform plan
conceive all the change that need to happen.

Apply is a multi-stage command

4 actions can be done:

- create
- change
- change with force recreate
- destroy

---

+ create
- destroy
~ change
-/+ create with force recreate

---

# Import

Problem: I already got infrastructure that is defined.
How can I manage it with terraform?

`$ terraform import scaleway_server.foobar 7b8f6ad6-f26b-4ffa-8464-e27fe22d40d4`

```
resource "scaleway_server" "foobar" {
  name  = "foobar"
  image = "857de28c-39ce-4b15-9389-b68d8bb1bb51"
  type  = "VC1S"
}
```
---

Terraform workspaces

- Copy of an infrastructure/state
- Every terraform has at least one workspace (default)
- terraform workspace new <name>
- terraform workspace list
- to switch terraform workspace select <name>
- terraform workspace delete <name>


"${terraform.workspace}"

---

Resource meta parameters

- count
- depends_on
- provider
- lifecycle

???

- ${count.index}
- force the dependency resolution
- multiple provider/zone
- lifecycle: `create_before_destroy`, `prevent_destroy`, `ignore_changes`


---

# Demo

- Be sure to run the checker that will tell if your envirnoment is ready
- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`
