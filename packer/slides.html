# Problem it solves

- How can I create a cloud image that is production ready?

```bash
packer build my-template.json
```

---

# How it works

- It creates an instance on Scaleway (`builder`)
- You run commands to install your application (`provisionner`)
- You snapshot your instance
- Your image is ready to be used

---

# Demo

```bash
packer build scaleway-cloud-courses-template.json
```
