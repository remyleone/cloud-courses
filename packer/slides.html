# Problem it solves

- How can I create a cloud image that is production ready?

  `packer build my-template.json`

---

# How it works

- It creates an instance on Scaleway (`builder`)
- You run commands to install your application (`provisionner`)
- You snapshot your instance
- Your image is ready to be used

# Demo

```bash
packer build -var "api_access_key=$SCW_ACCESS_KEY"
             -var "api_token=$SCW_TOKEN"
             scaleway-odoo-template.json
```
