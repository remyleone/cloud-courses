# Capital vs Operational Expenses (CAPEX / OPEX)

???

Capital expenses are those related to fixed assets, including both the original purchase and later improvements.
IT-related examples are the costs of comput- ing equipment and software.
Operational expenses are those associated with ordinary business operations.
IT-related examples include salaries of technical staff, Internet costs, and subscription-based software licenses.
This difference is important in business accounting and tax calculation.
The value of a capital expense is spread out (and deducted) over multiple fiscal years, while the value of an operational expense is considered to be used up in the fiscal year in which the expense originated, allowing the full value to be deducted.
