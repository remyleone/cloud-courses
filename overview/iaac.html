Problem:
    - Slow console
    - error prone
    - reproductibility (How to make a copy of your infrastructure?)
    - Up to date picture of what is deployed
    - No written description of what your infrastructure is like

- Solution: Deploy infrastructure as code.
  - Define your infratructure as machine readable
  - Use the same tools: git, editor, ...
