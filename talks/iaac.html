# Infrastructure as code support @ Scaleway

---

# `whoami`

- Rémy Léone
- Cloud Developer Advocate @Scaleway
- Maintainer of most Scaleway Ansible modules / plugins

---

# How things are usually done without IaaC

- Infrastructure were usually managed by tickets/manual instantiation
- Infrastructure churn was considered low
- Manual / Semi-automated installation

---

# ad-hoc management problems

- Not scalable
- No elasticity
- Non reproducible infrastructure
- No single source of truth about what the infrastructure is. 
    - So it is hard to recreate a copy for a pre-prod for instance

---

# Solution: Infrastructure as code

- Code that define infrastructure
- Uses tools to make the desired state match the declared state
    - Declarative paradigm
    - Idempotency as a by-results
- Files can be versionned and replayed
    - Single source of truth
    - Classical git workflow
- Infrastructure can be re-created
    - Reproducibility of the infastructure

# Terraform

```hcl
provider "scaleway" {
    region = "par1"
}

data "scaleway_image" "example03" {
    architecture = "x86_64"
    name         = "Ubuntu Bionic"
}

resource "scaleway_server" "example03" {
    name  = "example03"
    image = "${data.scaleway_image.example03.id}"
    type  = "START1-S"
}
```

- Tool from Hashicorp
- Resources description
- Diff-based operation: Local state (tfstate)  / Remote state in S3

# Ansible

```yaml
scaleway_compute:
    name: My server
    state: present
    image: 00000000-1111-2222-3333-111111111111
    organization: 00000000-1111-2222-3333-111111111111
    region: fr-par-1
    commercial_type: gp1-s
    wait: true
```

- Agent-less
- Sequential

???

- Direct SSH connetion 

---

# Other advantages

- Easier to grasp the infrastructure and contribute to it
- Align incentives between developer and operational to have a single source of truth that both can review and apply
- Easier to test a complete deployment using CI/CD
- Pet / Cattle paradigm
- Not cloud-agnostic but similar patterns
- Security

???

- You can sign code in git like any code. Everything can be automated

---

# Next step: Containerization

- Immutable infrastructure (Image built)
    - Packer / Ansible
    - Dockerfile
- Kubernetes
    - Declarative paradigm
    - Container based
