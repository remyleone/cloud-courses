# Cheat sheet

---

# How does it work on your computer?

- git persists its state in .git/
- all commands interacts with those files
- If this folder is gone, so is your history

# General best practices on git

- Know your commits. It is your work, your craft.
- Don't commit everything you are modifying `-p` is your friend 
- Write meaningful commit messages (Easier to understand during peer reviews)

# Many choices

(git does not care)

---

# github style

- master can be deployed. Always.
- Developper fork your project
- 1 feature per branch
- People open merge request if they want to get something merged
- feature is merged when reviewed, tested and accepted
- Other rebase if needed. That's your job to keep track with master.


References: Git for teams (Available upon request)

---

# Who makes the call to merge something?

- 100% dependent of the project
- Usually two +1 to get something merged

---

# How can I stay up to date with upstream changes?

- Merge or rebase strategy
http://gitforteams.com/resources/merge-rebase.html

- My favorite is rebase (Easier to read on the commit DAG)

---

# Eyes on the road

- git blame
- git log / your client visualization
- git reflog to see everything that happened on your local repository

---

# Reviews

- Automated gatekeeper
- Peer review

https://speakerdeck.com/nnja/code-review-skills-for-pythonistas-djangocon-2018

---

# General best practices on distributed development

- One change per commits (No little changes on the side!)
- Small commits that can be reviewed easily
- Add tests to your code that are launched automatically
- Published history should not be altered. Don't do that.
